1. Introduction						*viminette-intro*

The viminette is a simple plugin to highlight directly on your VIM editor the
lines containing 42 norm errors on a valid C source/header file.

The viminette does not check the norm by itself !
It runs the `norminette` shell command and parses the result for highlighting,
so make sure to have the official norminette correctly installed on your
system. You can get it at `https://github.com/42School/norminette`.

Once norm highlighting is enabled on a buffer, lines with norm errors are
highlighted if present, see |viminette-error-line|.

When the cursor is moved onto an error line, a popup displays the associated
error on top of it, see |viminette-error-popup|.

Enabled norm highlighting refreshes at each save (VIMdoc |BufWritePost|).
Disabled norm highlighting doesn't refresh until turned back on.

Don't hesitate to share the plugin with your friends, we all need to make the
norminette less painful to deal with ;)


ERROR LINES HIGHLIGHT					*viminette-error-line*

An error line has been parsed from the `norminette` system command call and
represents a line in which a norm error is present.
It is signified by a VIM sign placed at its beginning (VIMdoc |signs|) and
the whole line being highlighted with the 'ErrorSignLine' highlight.

Example :
	`s>	int  main(...`


ERROR POPUP			*viminette-error-col* *viminette-error-popup*

When the cursor is moved onto an error line and norm highlighting is enabled,
a popup (VIMdoc |popup|) on top of it displays the line's associated norm
error.

On the left part of the popup, a string displays on which column the error can
be found relative to the cursor column.
It can be formatted as follows:
	- `<0>` The error starts at the same column as the cursor
	- `<<N` The error starts `N` columns before the cursor
	- `N>>` The error starts `N` columns after the cursor

On the right part of the popup, a string dispays the line's error.

Example:
	`[ <<2 | found space when expecting tab ]`

2. Usage						*viminette-usage*

The plugin adds several commands for enabling/disabling norm highlighting and
navigating through the error lines.


ENABLING NORM HIGHLIGHTING				*viminette-enable*

							*:Norminette*
:Normi[nette] [options]
		Run the system norminette and enable 42 norm highlighting.
		Highlighting now refreshes by calling the norminette again
		after each file save until turned off or an error occurs.
		Run the norminette with [options] if set, e.g. for using the
		-RCheckDefine flag.
		After a refresh, the current buffer's 'normstatus' variable
		is set depending on the norm result.


DISABLING NORM HIGHLIGHTING				*viminette-disable*

							*:NoNorminette*
:NoN[orminette]
		Disable norm highlighting by hiding the error lines and the
		error popup and stop calling the norminette at each file save,
		see |viminette-error-line| |viminette-error-popup|.
		The current buffer's 'normstatus' variable is set to 0.


NAVIGATING ERROR LINES					*viminette-navigate*

							*:NormErrorMenu*
:NormE[rrorMenu]
		Open a popup menu at the center of the window for the user to
		select an error line to jump to, see |viminette-error-line|.
		The popup won't show up if 'normstatus' is not equal to 2.

							*:NextSign*
:NextS[ign]	Jump to the closest error line in the file after the cursor
		line, see |viminette-error-line|. Jump to the first one if
		none is present after the cursor.
		Don't jump if 'normstatus' is not equal to 2.

							*:PrevSign*
:Pr[evSign]	Jump to the closest error line in the file before the cursor
		line, see |viminette-error-line|. Jump to the last one if none
		is present before the cursor.
		Don't jump if 'normstatus' is not equal to 2.

							*:NextSignCycle*
:NextSignC[ycle]
		Cycle through the error lines from top to bottom, see
		|viminette-error-line|. Jump back to the firt one from the
		last one.
		Don't jump if 'normstatus' is not equal to 2.

							*:PrevSignCycle*
:PrevSignC[ycle]
		Cycle through the error lines from bottom to top, see
		|viminette-error-line|. Jump back to the last one from the
		first one.
		Don't jump if 'normstatus' is not equal to 2.

==============================================================================
3. Mappings						*viminette-mappings*

The plugin also comes with some key mappings for faster norm toggling and
navigation.

							*CTRL-M*
CTRL-M		Switch norm highlighting ON / OFF and update 'normstatus'.

							*CTRL-K*
CTRL-K		Open the norm error popup menu.

							*CTRL-N*
CTRL-N		Jump to the closest error line in the file after the cursor
		line, see |viminette-error-line|. Jump to the first one if
		none is present after the cursor.

							*CTRL-B*
CTRL-B		Jump to the closest error line in the file before the cursor
		line, see |viminette-error-line|. Jump to the last one if none
		is present before the cursor.

==============================================================================
4. Variables						*viminette-variables*

							*normstatus*
'normstatus'	number (default 0)
		local to buffer
	Stores the norm highlighting status of its buffer.
