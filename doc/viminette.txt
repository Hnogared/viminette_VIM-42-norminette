1. Usage						*ViminetteUsage*

The plugin adds several commands for enabling/disabling norm highlighting and
navigating through the errors.


ENABLING NORM HIGHLIGHTING				*norm-enable*

							*:Norminette*
:Normi[nette] [options]
		Run the system norminette and enable 42 norm highlighting.
		Highlighting now refreshes by calling the norminette again
		after each file save (see |BufWritePost|) until turned off or
		an error occurs.
		After a refresh, the current buffer's 'normstatus' variable
		is set.
		Run the norminette with [options] if set, e.g. for using the
		-RCheckDefine flag.

DISABLING NORM HIGHLIGHTING				*norm-disable*

							*:NoNorminette*
:NoN[orminette]
		Disable norm highlighting and stop calling the norminette at
		each file save.
		The current buffer's 'normstatus' variable is set to 0.


NAVIGATING ERROR LINES					*error-lines-jump*

							*:NormErrorMenu*
:NormE[rrorMenu]
		Open a popup menu at the center of the window for the user to
		select an error line to jump to.
		The popup won't show up if 'normstatus' is not equal to 2.

							*:NextSign*
:NextS[ign]	Jump to the closest error line in the file after the cursor
		line. Jump to the first one if none is present after the
		cursor.

							*:PrevSign*
:Pr[evSign]	Jump to the closest error line in the file before the cursor
